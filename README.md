# Visual transformer for MNIST handwriting digit classification 
Visual transformer (ViT), which was trained on the MNIST dataset can achieve an accuracy of 99.96%. However, it is important to note that the MNIST dataset is a relatively simple dataset. It consists of small images of handwritten digits with a limited amount of variation. Overall, ViTs are a promising approach to image classification.
